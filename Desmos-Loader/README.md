A list of known issues is compiled below:
1)Q: Frame not showing up<br>A: Click the Arrow Down button, then the Arrow Right.<br>
2)Q: Test Questions Cleared when Arrow Down pressed.<br>A: This is INTENDED behaviour. There is no way to recover the lost questions. The reason for this is the refreshing of the frame.<br>
